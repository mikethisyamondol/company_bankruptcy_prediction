The purpose of this project is to predict whether a company is bankrupt based on a number of financial attributes. The models fit include Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Extra Trees. The dataset has also been transformed to balance out the classes in the training set by oversampling the minority class using both resampling and SMOTE. The evaluation metrics used are based off ROC AUC which measures the separability, or the model's ability of distinguishing between the two classes: Bankrupt vs. Not Bankrupt. The evaluation metric will change depending on the objective or utility of the model. For example, if the utility is to determine investment opportunities, then a false negative (type 2 error) might be have more adverse effects than a false positive (type 1 error), in which case evaluating models on recall/sensitivity or specificity might be beneficial.
